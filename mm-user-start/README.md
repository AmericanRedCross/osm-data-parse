### mm-user-start

gets all users from the osm-stats-api and then gets their first edit_time and exports a CSV

yeah, this is entirely **not necessary** for what it was made for. just use:
`http://osmstats.redcross.org/hashtags/{{hashtag}}/users`
`http://osmstats.redcross.org/hashtags/missingmaps/users`
